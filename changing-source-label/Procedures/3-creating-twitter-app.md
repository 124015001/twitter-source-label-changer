# Creating a Twitter App

Creating a twitter app is same as customizing your twitter source label. 

So, once you get approval from twitter for being selected into twitter developer. Now you have to create an app.

- Open this [link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). You will be directed to the Dashboard of your developer account as shown below.

- Now, go to Project & Apps, and inside that click on Overview. As, I have already customized my source label once you can see that under Overview.
