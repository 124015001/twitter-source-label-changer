So the basic eligibility, to get into Twitter Developer and to access their API tools, is to have a Twitter account first.

Incase, if you already have a developer account then skip reading this file and directly go to see the other procedures.

- Since, I am a Student so went with Academic and under that chose Student's option. You might choose whatever you feel like or whatever role suits you the best.

- During the app creation process, you'll need to provide information about your use case, the type of access you need (such as read-only access or read/write access to Twitter data), and details about how you plan to use the Twitter API.
